# Overview
This project is a C++ program that calculates the win probability for two players in a simplified version of [Yut Nori]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnori)), a traditional Korean board game. 

This simulator uses dynamic programming to compute the probability of Player 1 winning given the starting positions of both players.

The program models the game mechanics, including the probabilities of different moves (DO, GAE, GUL, YUT, MO), the board's unique paths and shortcuts, and the win condition (returnin back to position 0). It also measures the runtime of the computation for performance analysis.
